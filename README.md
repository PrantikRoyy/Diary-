This program is a website that allows users to make their own password-protected online diary where diaries can be
shown publicly with the author's permission but the diaries can only be edited by the
author. A casual user can click on any of the diaries to go to a new tab where all the
visible links to the entries of that diary can be shown in order. If an entry link is clicked,
the user goes to a new tab where the entry is shown along with a next/prev option at the
top to go to different entries like flipping pages in a diary. Each entry will have its own
topics with text and name. The general idea is to have a password and username input
at the bottom to access one’s personal diary as the author to edit all their diaries in a
separate tab. Once the user logs in to their diary as an author, they gain the option to
make/delete new entries or make them visible. Once the user clicks on an entry they will
go to a book view where the entries of the diary will be shown in “pages” that can be
“flipped”. Said entries will have topics that come in the form of a box with a section for
text and another section for images that will get displayed along with the text. A user
can have the option to make/delte as many topics as they want with each topics having
a visibility option in the form that makes the entry visible or non-visible publicly. Once
the users are done editing the topic. (Note: Due to the difficulty in implementing a server
for this website, the information inputted to the dairies and their entries and topics will
not be saved and the visibility option will be left non-functional since all the information
is reset as soon as one of the website pages is closed.) Once they are done editing all
the entries, the user can press a logout button at the top right to log out of author view
and go back to the normal public view.
